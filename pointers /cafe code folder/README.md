Coffee Shop Billing System â˜•

This is a simple C++ program that calculates the total bill for a coffee order.
It demonstrates the use of pointers for accessing variable values.

Description

The program sets fixed prices for three types of coffee: Espresso (200), Latte (500), and Cappuccino (900).
The user enters the number of cups they want for each coffee type. Using pointers, the program multiplies each price with the respective quantity and sums them to calculate the total bill.

There is a small mistake in the calculation: the Cappuccino quantity is mistakenly replaced with the Latte quantity in the total bill formula. If corrected, the program will display the accurate bill.

Example Run

User enters the number of Espresso, Latte, and Cappuccino.

The program calculates the bill by multiplying the price and quantity of each coffee.

The final total is displayed on the screen.

Usage
